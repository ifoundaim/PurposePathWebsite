- Update button markup in `components/Header.tsx`, `components/ContactForm.tsx`, `components/SubscribeForm.tsx`, and `app/page.tsx` to use shared label spans.
- Keep style texture by scoping the menu-like pastel background to the contact submit action via `.contact-submit` in `components/ContactForm.tsx` and `app/globals.css`.
- Replace the homepage hero `<video>` with `components/HeroVideo.tsx` to default playback volume to `50%`, add a dedicated mute/unmute control, auto-mute when other media plays, and keep background playback running if paused.
- Style the hero audio toggle overlay in `app/globals.css` for reliable click handling over video.
- Add regression coverage in `tests/site.spec.ts` for hero audio toggle behavior, media-priority auto-mute, and pause-resume guard logic.
- Make header `CONTACT US` actions match the `Menu` button surface by applying a shared `.menu-surface` class in `components/Header.tsx` and `app/globals.css`.
- Set hero video default startup volume to `40%` and keep sound-on preference (no forced mute fallback) in `components/HeroVideo.tsx`.
- Extend regression checks in `tests/site.spec.ts` to assert hero startup state initializes at `volume: 0.4` and `muted: false`.

- Apply a V1 holographic "pop pass" in `app/globals.css` by introducing tunable holo variables for border/glow opacity, blur, surface tint, and label micro-shadow.
- Increase idle border definition, make glow visible at rest, and rebalance hover/active intensity so buttons pop on off-white while preserving the existing rainbow animation behavior.
- Deepen key cyan/magenta gradient stops and add subtle local surface tint on `.button.secondary` and `.menu-button` for stronger contrast on light backgrounds.
- Build a "Pastel Prism" art direction in `app/globals.css` with warm/cool/lilac section atmosphere layers, frosted card surfaces, pearl-like sheens, and harmonized pastel holographic accents.
- Update homepage section wrappers in `app/page.tsx` to apply `section-prism-warm`, `section-prism-cool`, and `section-prism-lilac` atmosphere classes.
- Fix holographic border animation looping in `app/globals.css` by using repeating border gradient layers and seamless keyframe endpoints (`background-position` and hue cycle) to remove end-of-cycle snap/reset artifacts.
- Add regression coverage in `tests/site.spec.ts` to assert seamless holographic keyframe endpoints and expected gradient tiling configuration.
- Remove remaining holographic loop snap by switching border/glow pseudo-element animations to `alternate` direction and eliminating keyframe hue-rotation transitions in `app/globals.css`.
- Strengthen holographic regression checks in `tests/site.spec.ts` by asserting runtime pseudo-element animation direction/names in addition to keyframe and tiling expectations.
- Replace direct subscribe submission in `components/SubscribeForm.tsx` with client-side POST to `/api/subscribe`, adding inline loading, success, and error feedback states.
- Add `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` with server-side email validation, safe Formspree forwarding via `lib/forms.ts`, and resilient JSON responses for misconfiguration/upstream failures.
- Add hero media fallback handling in `components/HeroVideo.tsx` so failed video loads render a dedicated fallback shell and hide the audio toggle.
- Expand `app/globals.css` with hero fallback visuals, subscribe feedback styles, disabled button treatment, and mobile responsiveness improvements for spacing, typography, and tap-target comfort.
- Extend `tests/site.spec.ts` with regression checks for subscribe API wiring/UI feedback, hero fallback rendering, and mobile viewport control visibility; also harden existing selectors/assertions for stable execution.
- Add shimmer sweep animation to scroll-reveal and stagger-item elements in `app/globals.css` with `revealShimmerSweep` keyframes, pastel gradient overlay, and `prefers-reduced-motion` respect.
- Rename "Marketing Services" to "Skill Offers" across `app/services/page.tsx`, `components/Header.tsx`, and `tests/site.spec.ts`.
- Reorganize services page into Development & Design and Marketing & Content sections; add MVVP App Development card to Development section.
- Fix review avatar image URL in `app/services/page.tsx` to use raw GitHub URL for correct display.
- Add regression test in `tests/site.spec.ts` for scroll-reveal shimmer sweep keyframes and revealed-state pseudo-element styling.
- Introduce reusable `.card-soft` and `.card-holo` visual variants in `app/globals.css`, and apply them across `app/page.tsx`, `app/services/page.tsx`, and `app/contact-us/page.tsx`.
- Correct the services offer title typo from "MVVP" to "MVP" in `app/services/page.tsx`.
- Replace contact founder image source with `READY 2 GO.jpg` raw GitHub URL and switch image sizing to `object-fit: contain` plus responsive `height: auto` in `app/contact-us/page.tsx` to prevent cropping.
- Expand regression coverage in `tests/site.spec.ts` for card-variant styling expectations and contact-page founder image source/sizing behavior.
- Switch subscription submission in `components/SubscribeForm.tsx` from `/api/subscribe` to direct Formspree posting via `subscribeFormEndpoint`, preserving inline validation/feedback UX for static-hosted deployment.
- Set the subscribe default endpoint to `https://formspree.io/f/xgolrloo` in `lib/forms.ts` so exported static builds remain wired when env vars are absent.
- Update subscribe-related assertions/mocks in `tests/site.spec.ts` to validate direct Formspree form action and mocked Formspree request handling.
- Add project setup docs in `README.md` and add a tracked `/.env.example`; update `.gitignore` to keep env files ignored while allowing `/.env.example` to be committed.
- Add latest Playwright run output under `test-results/` to capture current local test execution artifacts.
- Rename header nav label to `RouteForge`, update its canonical route to `/illustration-market`, and keep `/illistration-market` as a redirect compatibility route.
- Replace the old in-dev marketplace page with full RouteForge narrative copy in `app/illustration-market/page.tsx`, including both waitlist CTAs and PurposePath ecosystem sections.
- Add waitlist anchor behavior by linking both RouteForge waitlist CTAs to `#waitlist-subscribe` and tagging the footer subscribe area in `components/Footer.tsx`.
- Reuse holographic rainbow menu-label text styling for both inline RouteForge waitlist links in `app/illustration-market/page.tsx` and `app/globals.css` (without converting them into buttons).
- Expand Playwright regression coverage in `tests/site.spec.ts` for RouteForge nav/content, legacy-route redirect behavior, and waitlist CTA jump-to-subscribe interaction.
- Add a two-column RouteForge intro layout in `app/illustration-market/page.tsx` with narrative copy on the left and embedded YouTube video (`csNdmEslXU0`) on the right.
- Add responsive iframe styling in `app/globals.css` under `.video-frame iframe` to preserve a 16:9 aspect ratio and clean borderless rendering.
- Replace footer `Privacy Policy` link with internal `RouteForge` link in `components/Footer.tsx` pointing to `/illustration-market`.
- Set contact inquiry default Formspree endpoint to `https://formspree.io/f/mgolrlpe` in `lib/forms.ts`, keeping subscribe and inquiry endpoints distinct.
- Keep homepage hero video muted by default in `components/HeroVideo.tsx` by removing auto-unmute-on-load logic.
- Add regression coverage in `tests/site.spec.ts` asserting initial hero video `muted` state is `true` at page load.
